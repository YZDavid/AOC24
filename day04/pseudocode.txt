This problem seems a little tricky at first, but I think it is ok if you break it down into something like a graph problem.
What seems difficult is that there are so many possibilities of having XMAS spelled out. However, if you break down the problem,
you realise that it all matches has to start with the character X. We can search through the entire input and whenever we find X,
look for all possible XMAS combinations in all 8 directions. (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals)


Read input and represent the raw input as a 2D array
Use a double nested for loop to scan through the input array, looking out for X
When X is found, loop through the 8 directions and determine whether each direction can produce XMAS. Terminate early if it does not to save time.
Increment the count by one if a valid XMAS keyword is found.


Part 2 is arguably easier, search in 4 diagnoal directions by pair. Each diagnal pair should contain exclusively either M or S.
